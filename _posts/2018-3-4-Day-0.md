## Today's progress

I found a good start: [http://how2j.cn/k/ssm/ssm-tutorial/1137.html] After fiddling a bit I went straight to the
[http://how2j.cn/k/ssm/ssm-maven/1394.html](so called maven style) because I got very nervous at the very moment I see the first page
asking me to download a whole bunch of dependencies with **firefox**. Later I found that `gradle init` can convert it into a gradle project,
but no luck. There seems to be something wrong... no time to fix it. Let's focus on the key subject. Old maven can still do the job.

I've updated it a bit. Now it includes a new functionality: appendPages. This will append a category "categoryX", where X is the total 
row count, to the db.

I noticed a strange behavior, that `/listCategory`, an unmodified endpoint, is taking an extrodinary long time to make an respond. I've no
exact idea on this, yet the `com.github.pagehelper` looks very suspisious...

OK I figured out that this naive implementation is using a primitive, unpooled, inefficient data source. No doubt the database will cry out
for too frequent connecting to it, and 

>  that `/listCategory`, an unmodified endpoint, is taking an extrodinary long time to make an respond.

is simply because the database load is too high. F**k that. Now everything is fixed ~~except that paging can go beyound max row or below 0, 
which I decided to ignore~~.

I had a good time, and I call this the end of the day.
