# OpenCV and TX2
## Symptom
Most OpenCV CUDA call fails with some sort of error, including but not limited to

    (-219, Gpu Api) invalid device symbol
    (-217, ....

## Cause
TX2 is branded as Pascal architecture. It may be tempting to specify `-DCUDA_GENERATION=Pascal` at OpenCV build. 
However, TX2's arch is 6.2, not 6.0/6.1 (which is those for general GPUs like GTX1080 or Tesla).
According to a quick google search, 6.2 is for TX2/PX2 **only**.
If you specify `-DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=6.2` then it's fine.
If you don't specify it at all, OpenCV can also just detect it (provided it can).

My problem arose because I'm building inside a container, where there is no CUDA device driver available.
I have to specify it otherwise it will compile against all arch (which does include 6.2), but that will
bloat the resulting image. 

After trying to compile OpenCV on host, I manage to figure out that there is a difference in CMake output and that 
is the target GPU arch. I have sent the TX2 back into compiling now. Let's see if it solves the problem tomorrow.
