## Welcome to My Blog

Um, this blog begins since 2018-3-4. I'm primary an undergrad wandering around the IT field. I have no idea in which direction I should go.

Anyway, I decided to start learning SSM, the so called "better" J2EE framework. This may be seen as lagging behind, but I know people use it for a reason. After all, I'm still just an undergrad.
